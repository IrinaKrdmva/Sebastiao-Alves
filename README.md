## Overview

### The Project

I was tasked with making a responsive website for an Autor using everything I have learned. It is a complete functional website with various pages, database and backoffice, so the author can change anything, from images and text to the order in wich they are displayed.
I have included some screenshots but I can¬¥t include everything.üòÅ
